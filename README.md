# Description
This repository will consist of the following programs Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

## 1. numpy random notebook
A jupyter notebook explaining the concepts
behind and the use of the numpy random package, including plots
of the various distributions.

## 2. Iris dataset notebook
 A jupyter notebook explaining the famous iris data set including the difficulty in writing an algorithm to separate the three classes of iris based on the variables in the dataset.


## 3. MNIST dataset notebook
 A jupyter notebook explaining how to read the MNIST dataset efficiently into memory in Python.

## 4. Digit recognition script
A Python script that takes an image file containing a handwritten digit and identifies the digit using a supervised learning algorithm and the MNIST dataset.

## 5. Digit recognition notebook
A jupyter notebook explaining how the above Python script works and discussing its performance.

# How to run the program
The following files are a mix of Python files and Jupyter notebook files.

Python can be downloaded from [here](https://www.python.org/).

Once downloaded and installed, open a command prompt and run the following command to install Jupyter.

`pip install jupyter`

Once installed, download or clone this repository to your local machine. 

Simply navigate to the folder your just downloaded/cloned and run the following command in the directory of the folder

`jupyter notebook`

This will run a Juptyer notebook on your local machine in your default web browser.
